# Mastermind

This is an algorithm that simulates a game called Mastermind. The rules are as follows:

One player sets a color pattern and the other player has 10 chances to guess the pattern. Each round the pattern setter marks how many colors are correct, and also how many are also in the correct slot. It is up to the guesser to interpret the information and get the pattern correct as soon as possible.

The initial idea is for a ruby algorithm but it may be put into a more fleshed out online application.

Updates...

1/8/19 - The logic of the game has been created. From here an interface will be developed using rails. Initially there will be an online functionality but initially it will be just games vs computer.
